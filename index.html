        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>
                I grew up in Houston, Texas, playing baseball while developing an early interest in financial markets. I attended Texas State University where I majored in Finance and expanded on this passion through the university's selective Student Managed Investment Fund. Managing real capital solidified my goal of becoming a part of this industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                I continued my education with a Master's in Quantitative Finance & Economics, graduating in December 2025. My experiences since undergrad have positioned me to absorb information quickly and adapt across different areas of finance. From managing a $1.6M equity and fixed income portfolio to contributing to the management of $230 billion at a public pension fund, to leading equity research report competitions against top universities, I've built a foundation that spans valuation, portfolio construction, quantitative analysis, and client relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm most interested in working on an institutional platform where I can continue developing my portfolio and asset management skills. That said, my analytical background and experience with financial modeling, credit analysis, and company valuation have also prepared me for investment banking, credit analyst, and other valuation-focused roles. I'm drawn to opportunities where rigorous analysis drives real investment decisions, whether that's building portfolios, evaluating managers, or advising clients.

    <h3>Teacher Retirement System of Texas - Public Markets Intern</h3>
    <div class="date">June 2025 – August 2025 | Austin, Texas</div>
    
    <p>
        The Public Markets division at TRS manages roughly half of the $230 billion trust, making it the largest public pension in Texas. I experienced how institutional asset management actually works at scale across three very different rotations.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I started with the External Public Markets group, which maintains relationships with some of the most premier hedge funds in the industry. TRS is very active in these markets, and I saw where the evolution of fee structures came from as TRS pushed for more alignment through or structures instead of the traditional 2 and 20. My rotation consisted of analyzing two hedge funds being considered for full allocations. I saw the full due diligence process, considerations on portfolio fit, and finally, the major question: is this manager providing idiosyncratic alpha that justifies the fees allocators pay managers? I also saw how a fund of funds portfolio is managed and how it handles liquidity needs and risk metrics across multiple managers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        On the Internal Fundamental team, I saw the other half of Public Markets investing. The team is structured in pods, each running different investment strategies with their own focus and mandate. I was placed on a newly launched long only European value strategy that sought to generate alpha through strong security selection and a quantitative element to allocating weights to securities. I produced two equity research reports that informed portfolio construction decisions as the team built out this new fund.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Finally, I worked with Special Opportunities, which sits in a unique spot within Public Markets. The team invests in co-investment deals, convertibles, and other opportunities that don't fall neatly into either external or internal mandates. I researched the GP secondaries market, evaluating external managers and their co-investment opportunities. I provided recommendations on manager selection and market positioning.
    </p>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>CFA Institute Research Challenge - Team Lead</h3>
                <div class="date">December 2024 – March 2025 | Texas Regional Finalist</div>
                <p>
                    I led my team to the Texas Regional Finals of the CFA Institute Research Challenge. We covered AZZ Inc., a metal galvanizing company, and issued a Buy recommendation, a call we stood by even as tariff concerns emerged and other teams shifted to Hold. As of January 2026, the stock price has exceeded our price target by over 20%, validating our thesis.
The experience taught me the discipline of sticking to your analysis even when the market narrative shifts. We built our thesis on the company's fundamentals: strong financials, competitive positioning, and operational efficiency, not on macro noise. When we presented to a panel of CFA charterholders, it felt almost too easy to defend. The company needed no defense; the numbers spoke for themselves. But that's exactly what made it a good investment. We weren't forcing ourselves to love a business or ignoring its weaknesses. We found a solid company trading at an attractive valuation, did the work, and had conviction.
The challenge reinforced something critical about equity research: individual stock picking and rigorous analysis can generate real returns, but only if you remain objective. You can't fall in love with your thesis. You have to be willing to walk away if the fundamentals don't support it. In our case, they did, and the stock price and company financials have continued to prove that.
                </p>

                    After my internship at The Noble Group, I was selected for the 12-member Student Managed Investment Fund where I covered the Financials and Energy sectors. This experience taught me the importance of active management and security selection, and how individual stock picks fit together within a broader portfolio strategy.

                <h3>The Noble Group - Wealth Management Summer Intern</h3>

                <p>
                    This was my initial start in the industry, where I supported client investment portfolios, handled client interactions, and assisted with financial planning. It's where I first realized I enjoyed the analysis side of finance and wanted to expand on that. Working with a team of advisors overseeing $1.8B in assets, I gained exposure to how wealth management firms operate and serve high net worth clients.
I led an initiative to transition 401K advisory participants into the firm's wealth management services by crafting a customer database and building out the processes for lead generation and business funneling. The effort successfully added $10M to the firm's AUM. The experience gave me a foundation in client relationships and the business development side of wealth management, but more importantly, it clarified that I wanted to go deeper into the investment analysis and decision making process itself.
